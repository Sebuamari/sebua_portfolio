            <p>Iâ€™m Mariam Sebua, a dedicated Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong inclination 
                towards frontend development. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from 
                Tbilisi State University and have undergone extensive training in JavaScript and 
                front-end frameworks, as well as back-end development with C# and .NET. Currently, 
                I am honing my skills in a professional setting, focusing on creating responsive designs, 
                optimizing website performance, and resolving technical issues. Fluent in Georgian, 
                English, and German, I thrive in diverse and collaborative environments.</p>
